# Architecting an AI Assistant That Doesn't Forget: The Delegation Pattern

**Published: October 2025**

This week, I transformed how my AI coding assistant works. Instead of a single expensive context getting polluted with API syntax and shell commands, I built a delegation architecture that keeps the main assistant focused while dispatching specialized sub-agents for specific tasks.

The result: **50-70% cost savings** on API queries and a system that scales gracefully as I add more services.

## The Problem: Context Is Expensive

When you're working with a cutting-edge AI assistant like Claude Sonnet 4.5, every token counts. But here's what was happening:

```
User: "Show me my project issues"

Claude: *loads 5KB of API documentation*
       *constructs authentication headers*
       *parses JSON responses*
       *formats output*

Result: Main context polluted with API details
        Next query starts from this bloated state
        Expensive tokens wasted on boilerplate
```

This happened for **every** API interaction:
- Cloud infrastructure queries (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Monitoring system queries (New Relic, Datadog, etc.)
- Project tracking (Jira, GitHub Issues, Linear)
- Documentation systems (Confluence, Notion)

Each query added 5-10KB to the context. After 5-10 interactions, the assistant would "forget" earlier parts of the conversation as context limits approached.

## The Solution: Delegate, Don't Accumulate

I implemented a **delegation agent pattern** inspired by microservices architecture:

```
Main Assistant (Expensive Model)
    â”œâ”€ Recognizes: "project", "issue", "ticket"
    â”œâ”€ Delegates to: Project Tracking Sub-Agent (cheaper model)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Reads: AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md (227 lines)
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Uses: ~/bin/project-* shell wrappers
    â”‚   â””â”€ Returns: Clean formatted results
    â””â”€ Main context cost: < 1KB (just delegation logic)
```

**Key insight:** The main assistant doesn't need to know *how* to query your project tracker. It just needs to know *when* to delegate and *what* to do with the results.

## The Architecture: 7 Layers of Delegation

### 1. Recognition (Gospel-Level Documentation)

```markdown
# Startup Documentation Pattern

â›” CRITICAL: Project Tracking Query Delegation Pattern

IF user mentions ANY of these keywords:
- project, issue, ticket, bug, story

THEN you MUST delegate to a sub-agent. DO NOT handle directly.
```

These "forceful" startup docs load every session with â›” warnings that are impossible to miss.

### 2. Shell Wrappers (Guard Rails)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ~/bin/project-mine - Show issues assigned to me

TOKEN="<embedded-token>"
ACCOUNT_ID="<embedded-id>"

curl -s -u "user@example.com:$TOKEN" \
  "https://api.example.com/search" \
  -G --data-urlencode "jql=assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done" \
  | jq -r '.issues[] | "\(.key): \(.fields.summary)"'
```

**Why wrappers matter:**
- âœ… Authentication embedded (no token extraction errors)
- âœ… Proven patterns (tested manually before automation)
- âœ… Clean output (formatted for human reading)
- âœ… Guard rails (prevent destructive operations)

### 3. Agent Instructions (Domain Knowledge)

```markdown
# AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md (227-443 lines per service)

## Decision Tree

User query contains PROJECT-####?
  YES â†’ Use project-show PROJECT-####

User asking "what issues do I have"?
  YES â†’ Use project-mine

User searching for keyword?
  YES â†’ Use project-search "keyword" --mine --open
```

Each sub-agent gets complete domain knowledge:
- When to use which wrapper
- How to format output
- Error handling patterns
- Example queries and responses

### 4. Context7 Integration (On-Demand Documentation)

```markdown
## API Documentation (Context7 MCP)

If you need help with API syntax:

mcp__context7__resolve-library-id("api name")
mcp__context7__get-library-docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID: "/org/project",
  topic: "advanced filtering syntax",
  tokens: 3000
)
```

For complex queries, sub-agents can fetch live API documentation without polluting the main context.

### 5. Delegation Skill (How to Invoke)

```markdown
# SKILL.md - Main delegation logic

1. Read AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. Invoke Task tool:
   Task(
     subagent_type: "general-purpose",
     description: "Query project tracking system",
     prompt: "<paste agent instructions>

     USER REQUEST: <user's exact request>"
   )
3. Present results to user
```

### 6. Testing Protocol (Validation)

Every service gets tested in a fresh session:

```bash
# Test delegation in fresh environment
# Verify:
# - Delegation happened automatically
# - Sub-agent chose correct wrapper
# - Results are accurate
# - Main context < 1KB
```

### 7. Continuous Refinement (Self-Healing)

During testing, sub-agents can discover the correct API even when wrappers are broken:

```
Wrapper attempt 1: entitySearch API (failed)
Sub-agent adapted: Tried violationsSearch
Sub-agent adapted: Tried alertPolicies
Sub-agent discovered: aiIssues API (success!)
```

You update the wrapper based on the sub-agent's discovery. The system **self-heals through iteration**.

## What I Built: Examples

### Service #1: Cloud Infrastructure Delegation âœ…

**5 shell wrappers:**
- `cloud-instances-list` - List compute instances with filters
- `cloud-storage-list` - List storage buckets/objects
- `cloud-iam-keys` - List IAM access keys
- `cloud-deploy` - Deploy services
- `cloud-profile` - Show/switch cloud profiles

**Bonus:** Integrated with existing CLI tools when available

**Test result:**
```
User: "list running cloud instances"
Main Claude: [delegates to sub-agent]
Sub-agent: cloud-instances-list --state running
Result: 122 running instances, clean formatted output
Main context: < 1KB
```

### Service #2: Monitoring System Delegation âœ…

**7 shell wrappers:**
- `monitor-query` - Execute monitoring queries
- `monitor-alerts` - List active alerts
- `monitor-apps` - List monitored applications
- `monitor-logs` - Quick log searching
- `monitor-verify` - Verify query syntax
- `monitor-rules` - List/manage filtering rules
- `monitor-patterns` - Analyze log patterns & detect anomalies

**Bonus:** Pattern analysis with 3 modes:
```bash
monitor-patterns                        # Recent patterns
monitor-patterns --compare "1 hour"     # What's NEW?
monitor-patterns --anomalies            # Unusual volume
```

**Test result:**
```
User: "show me active monitoring alerts"
Main Claude: [delegates to sub-agent]
Sub-agent: monitor-alerts
Result: No active alerts (3 recently cleared)
Main context: < 1KB
```

### Service #3: Enhanced All Delegations with Context7

Added API documentation integration to all services:
- Project Tracking: Query syntax, field mappings, formatting
- Cloud Infrastructure: Advanced filtering, policies, infrastructure-as-code
- Monitoring: Query language, schema, API capabilities

Sub-agents can now fetch comprehensive documentation on-demand without loading it into main context.

## Cost Savings & Performance

### Before Delegation

```
Query cost: 5-10KB per interaction
10 queries/day Ã— 4 services = 40 queries
Daily cost: 200-400KB in expensive model tokens
Monthly: ~6-12MB expensive tokens

Result: Context bloat, forgotten conversations
```

### After Delegation

```
Main context: < 1KB delegation logic
Sub-agent: 5-10KB (cheaper model)
10 queries/day Ã— 4 services = 40 queries
Daily savings: 150-300KB moved to cheaper tier
Monthly: ~4.5-9MB cost reduction

Result: 50-70% savings + clean main context
```

**Actual measured savings:**
- Cloud: 70% reduction (122 instances query: 800 bytes vs 6KB)
- Project Tracking: 65% reduction (issue search: 600 bytes vs 5KB)
- Monitoring: 60% reduction (alert query: 700 bytes vs 8KB)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Forceful Documentation Works

The â›” emoji and "CRITICAL" headers in startup docs are not negotiable. They ensure delegation happens **automatically** without user intervention.

```markdown
â›” CRITICAL: DO NOT handle cloud queries directly
â›” CRITICAL: DO NOT construct API calls manually
â›” CRITICAL: MUST delegate to sub-agent
```

### 2. TDD for Shell Wrappers

Test each wrapper manually **before** building the skill:

```bash
# Test locally first
~/bin/monitor-alerts
# Output: No active alerts found.

# Then build delegation skill
# Confidence: High (wrapper works)
```

### 3. 5-7 Wrappers Is The Sweet Spot

- Cover the 80% use case with custom wrappers
- Point to existing tools for the rest
- Don't recreate the wheel

### 4. Sub-Agents Can Self-Heal

When wrappers have errors, sub-agents can:
1. Try the provided wrapper (failed)
2. Analyze the error message
3. Explore alternative APIs
4. Find the working solution
5. Return successful results

You update the wrapper based on the sub-agent's discovery.

### 5. Testing Protocol Is Critical

Testing in a fresh session reveals:
- Does delegation trigger automatically?
- Does sub-agent choose the right tool?
- Are results accurate?
- Is main context staying clean?

## What's Next

**Completed (Examples):**
- âœ… Cloud infrastructure delegation
- âœ… Monitoring system delegation

**Remaining (Your Services):**
- ðŸ”„ CDN/cache management (cache purging, configuration)
- ðŸ”„ Documentation system (wiki search, page management)

Each service takes ~2-3 hours to build and test:
- 1 hour: Shell wrappers (TDD)
- 1 hour: Agent instructions and delegation skill
- 30 min: Forceful documentation
- 30 min: Testing in fresh session

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about saving tokens. It's about **architectural thinking** for AI assistants:

### Before: Monolithic Context
```
One huge context with everything:
- API documentation
- Shell commands
- Authentication details
- Business logic
- Conversation history

Problem: Runs out of space, forgets things
```

### After: Microservices Pattern
```
Main Assistant (orchestrator):
- Business logic
- Conversation continuity
- High-level decisions

Specialized Sub-Agents (workers):
- Domain expertise (Project tracking, Cloud, etc)
- API details
- Tool execution
- Results formatting

Problem solved: Scales infinitely
```

### The Gospel Pattern

Every system needs **gospel documentation** - rules that override defaults:

```
startup-docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ 00-gospel.md              # Operating system rules
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-project-delegation.md  # â›” NEVER handle projects directly
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-protocol.md            # â›” ALWAYS follow protocols
â”œâ”€â”€ 03-cloud-delegation.md    # â›” NEVER run cloud commands
â””â”€â”€ 04-monitor-delegation.md  # â›” NEVER construct queries
```

These load **every session** and are marked with â›” to be impossible to ignore.

## Try It Yourself

The pattern is portable. To implement for any API:

1. **Identify 5-7 most common operations**
2. **Build guard-railed shell wrappers** in `~/bin/`
3. **Write comprehensive agent instructions** (200-400 lines)
4. **Create delegation skill** (when to delegate, how to invoke)
5. **Add forceful startup documentation** (â›” CRITICAL sections)
6. **Test in fresh session** (verify automatic delegation)

Template structure:
```
skills/{category}/delegating-to-{service}-agent/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md                    # Main delegation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md       # Sub-agent knowledge
â””â”€â”€ USAGE-EXAMPLE.md            # Examples

bin/
â”œâ”€â”€ {service}-{operation}       # Shell wrapper 1
â”œâ”€â”€ {service}-{operation}       # Shell wrapper 2
â””â”€â”€ ...

config/startup-docs/
â””â”€â”€ 0X-{service}-delegation.md  # â›” Forceful documentation
```

## Closing Thoughts

Building this delegation architecture taught me that **AI assistants need architecture** just like distributed systems do:

- **Separation of concerns** (main context vs specialized sub-agents)
- **Guard rails** (shell wrappers prevent dangerous operations)
- **Self-healing** (sub-agents can explore and discover solutions)
- **Scalability** (add services without bloating main context)
- **Testing protocols** (validate behavior in realistic scenarios)

The result is an AI assistant that stays focused, doesn't forget important context, and scales gracefully as you add more services.

**Total investment:** ~6 hours over 2 days
**Return:** 50-70% cost savings + infinite scalability
**Next service:** 2-3 hours (pattern is established)

The architecture is working. Time to add more services.
